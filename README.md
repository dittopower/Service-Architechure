# Service-Architechure
A Uni project about making interconnecting web services

A service of limited standin web services were created using a mixture of Java and .net with REST & SOAP web services.
The services make calls to each other during operation as complex realworld business systems do.

See the .html files in the main directory for the functionalitys of each.
